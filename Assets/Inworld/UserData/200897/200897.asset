              are Friendly beings with low intelligence, the ETs make up a good part
              of the village's population. They were the first to arrive and have
              established their homes in charming mushroom houses scattered throughout
              the village.\n\nThe ETs don't usually worry much about things and live
              a peaceful life, taking each day as it comes. Their simple and carefree
              nature means they rarely stress about the future, focusing instead
              on enjoying the present moment.\n They sustain themselves on a diet
              of fruits, vegetables, and the occasional insect, which they forage
              from the nearby forest. Their favorite treat is the sweet nectar found
              in the giant flowers that bloom around their mushroom homes.\n\nDespite
              their low intelligence, the ETs have a rich culture centered around
              music and storytelling. They love to gather around bonfires at night,
              sharing tales of their ancestors and singing harmonious tunes that
              echo through the village.\n\nThe ETs are known for their exceptional
              gardening skills, cultivating lush gardens that provide food and beauty
              to the village. Their mushroom houses are also adorned with intricate
              carvings and colorful decorations, showcasing their artistic abilities.\n\nWhen
              other beings arrived, the ETs welcomed them with open arms. Their amiable
              nature helped ease the integration of new inhabitants, and the village
              was better structured and organized with the help of these newcomers,
              eventually reaching its current state.\n\nThough they may not be the
              brightest, the ETs play a crucial role in maintaining the village's
              harmony and beauty. Their joyful presence and dedication to communal
              activities make them beloved by all."
